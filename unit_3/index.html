			<p>I am a UX Product Designer based in Boston. When I'm not working or teaching yoga, I seek environments and experiences that encourage my intuition, imagination and creativity.</p>

			<p>I have a deep respect for the human condition and look at design as a means of directing energy in order to effectively disrupt what is out of date and in need of innovation.</p>
