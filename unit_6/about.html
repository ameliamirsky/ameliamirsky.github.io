						<h1>Hi! I'm Amelia. It's nice to meet you! &hearts;</h1>
						<p>I am a UX Product Designer at Ellevation Education in Boston. Since starting 4 years ago, I've had the opportunity to contribute in several roles; starting in Product Support, transitioning to Quality Assurance, and now most recently in Product Design.</p>
						<p>I have a deep respect for the human condition, and I like to look at design as a means of directing my energy into restoring what is out of date or in need of innovation.</p>
						<p>When I'm not working or teaching yoga, I'm probably cooking, eating, or seeking environments and experiences that encourage my intuition, imagination and creativity.</p>
						<p>I love to collaborate and chat over a good cup of coffee - so feel free to get in touch or recommend a spot.</p>
