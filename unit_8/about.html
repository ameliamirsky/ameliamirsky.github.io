            <h3>Amelia is a UX Product Designer at <br/><a href="http.ellevationeducation.com">Ellevation Education</a> in Boston.
            </h3>
            <p>Since starting 4 years ago, she has had the opportunity to contribute in several roles; starting in Product Support, transitioning to Quality Assurance, and now most recently in Product Design.</p>
            <p>She has a deep respect for the human condition, and looks at design as a means of directing energy into restoring what is out of date or in need of innovation.</p>
            <p>When she's not working or teaching yoga, she's probably cooking, eating, or seeking environments and experiences that encourage her intuition, imagination and creativity.</p>
            <p>She loves to collaborate and chat over a good cup of coffee - so feel free to get in touch or recommend a spot.
