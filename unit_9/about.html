            <p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-size: larger; color:#E8C2CA;">Nice to meet you.</p>
            <p>I'm a UX designer based in Boston, currently working at <a href="http.ellevationeducation.com">Ellevation Education</a>. We partner with school districts who use our products to manage complex program requirements, build the capacity of their
                teachers and help English Learners reach their highest aspirations. I have had the opportunity to contribute in several roles at Ellevation; starting in Product Support, transitioning to Quality Assurance, and now most recently in Product
                Design.
            </p>
            <p>I have a deep respect for the human condition, and I'm energized by exploring new mediums and industries &mdash; from social good to emerging technologies &mdash; to learn how design can be leveraged in order to restore what is out of date
                or in need of innovation.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I teach yoga, travel as much as I can, and try to seek environments and experiences that encourage my intuition, imagination and creativity. I love to collaborate or connect over a good cup of coffee - so please feel free
                to get in touch or recommend a spot!</p>
